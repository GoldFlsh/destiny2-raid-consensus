## Raiding Expectations

### Mission
We're hoping to get through the 4 active Destiny 2 raids blind without looking up strategy guides.
Those raids are: Last Wish, Garden of Salvation, Deep Stone Crypt, and Vault of Glass.

And if we're still having fun, then we can move on to the new Witch Queen raid(s)

### Blind Raiding
Blind raiding is a unique experience and it's important for the health of the group that we don't have to worry about suspecting people of looking up strategies even if we wipe dozens of times on the same encounter. Figuring the encounter out and making steady progress on the mechanics as we disocver and tweak them makes blind raiding more rewarding than regular raiding and falls apart if someone in the raid is impatient and googles the answer.

### Be Patient
Raiding is some of the most challenging content in the game. Go in with the expectatation that we will make very slow progress, we will die collectively as a group a lot. Best to just enjoy that and laugh with each other. The cliche about the journey mattering more than the destination applies very much in this kind of raiding.

I'm not really sure how hard all of the old raids are actually going to be, so we could just breeze through but in the event that the difficulty is too hard don't feel disheartened.

### Have Fun


### Play Your Own Character
Its important that everyone has agency over their own character and how they want to play it. Feel free to provide each other with build or subclass suggestions, however at the end of the day if someone disregards your feedback or advice that's their choice to make don't take it personally. 

### Scheduling
Raiding works best if you commit to a weekly schedule, or else it becomes hard to get everyone at the same time to do it. Think of this like your weekly Dungeons and Dragons group for the forseeable future :) 

Open question? How often (re: 1 day a week)? And what night/time works best for everyone. How long do we want to go for? 
(3 hours is typically a pretty good number for this)

### Breaks
Open question: How do we want to handle structured breaks? Couple smaller breaks every hour e.g. 5m or one bigger 10m break halfway through are two options.

#### Giving Notice
Since raiding requires 6 people to show up to participate, it's important that if you know you won't be able to make it you give some notice.

Open Question: How do we want to handle it as a group when someone can't make it?
Couple options are - go into the raid with 5 and try to figure it out from there. Find a replacement for the night. Call it and try again next week?
